# Preprocess/clean

We clean the ID and convert the year-built of the house into its age. 

    data$date <- as.Date(substr(data$date, 1, 8), format = "%Y%m%d")
    data$yr_renovated[data$yr_renovated == 0] <- NA
    data <- data[!duplicated(data$id), ]
    current_year <- as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))
    data$age <- ifelse(is.na(data$yr_renovated), current_year - data$yr_built, current_year - data$yr_renovated)

    data <- data[-c(1)]
    data <- data[-c(15)]

    data$number_of_rooms <- data$bedrooms + data$bathrooms
